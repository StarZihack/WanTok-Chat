      </ul>

      <h2>7. Security</h2>
      <p>We take reasonable measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. This includes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Encrypting passwords and sensitive data</li>
        <li>Using secure HTTPS connections</li>
        <li>Regularly updating security protocols</li>
        <li>Limiting employee access to personal information</li>
      </ul>
      <p>However, no method of transmission over the internet is 100% secure. While we strive to protect your data, we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

      <h2>8. Automated Content Moderation and Safety</h2>
      <p>To maintain a safe environment for all users, WanTok employs <strong>automated content moderation</strong> using artificial intelligence technology. Here's how it works:</p>

      <h3>8.1 Automated Nudity and Inappropriate Content Detection</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>AI Screening:</strong> We use third-party AI services (such as Sightengine) to automatically analyze video frames during chat sessions to detect nudity, sexually explicit content, weapons, drugs, and other inappropriate material.</li>
        <li><strong>When Screening Occurs:</strong> Automated checks may occur when you first connect to a chat and when another user reports inappropriate behavior.</li>
        <li><strong>Screenshot Capture:</strong> When moderation checks are performed, a single frame (screenshot) from your video stream may be temporarily captured and sent to our AI service provider for analysis. <strong>These screenshots are analyzed immediately and are not permanently stored by WanTok.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Automatic Disconnection:</strong> If inappropriate content is detected above our safety thresholds, you will be automatically disconnected from the chat and may be temporarily or permanently banned from the Service.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>8.2 Minor Protection</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Zero Tolerance:</strong> Any content that may involve minors in inappropriate situations is treated as <strong>strictly prohibited and unsafe</strong>. Our AI systems are configured with very strict thresholds for such content.</li>
        <li><strong>Immediate Action:</strong> Users displaying or involved in content that may endanger minors will be immediately banned and reported to appropriate authorities as required by law.</li>
        <li><strong>Age Verification:</strong> We require all users to verify they are 18 years or older. Content involving individuals who appear to be minors is flagged for immediate review and action.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>8.3 User Reporting System</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Report Feature:</strong> Users can report inappropriate behavior by clicking the "Report" button during or after a chat.</li>
        <li><strong>AI-Assisted Review:</strong> When you report another user for nudity or minor-related concerns, we may automatically capture a screenshot of their video and analyze it using AI to verify the report.</li>
        <li><strong>Human Moderation Team:</strong> All reports are logged and reviewed by our dedicated human moderation team. Reports confirmed by AI may result in immediate automated action, while reports that require additional context are manually reviewed by trained moderators who make final decisions on enforcement actions.</li>
        <li><strong>Reporter Privacy:</strong> Your identity as a reporter is kept confidential and is not shared with the reported user.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>8.4 How Screenshots Are Handled</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Screenshots are captured solely for the purpose of content moderation and safety enforcement.</li>
        <li><strong>Temporary Storage:</strong> Screenshots are sent to our AI provider (Sightengine) for real-time analysis and are not permanently stored on our servers or by the AI provider after analysis is complete.</li>
        <li><strong>No Recording:</strong> We do not record full video or audio conversations. Only single frames are captured when moderation checks are triggered.</li>
        <li><strong>Third-Party Processing:</strong> Sightengine processes screenshots in accordance with their privacy policy. They do not use your images for purposes other than providing moderation services.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>8.5 Your Consent</h3>
      <p>By using WanTok, you consent to automated content moderation, including the temporary capture and analysis of video frames for safety purposes. If you do not consent to this moderation, you should not use the Service.</p>

      <h2>9. Children's Privacy</h2>
      <p>WanTok is <strong>not intended for users under 18 years of age</strong>. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If we discover that a child under 18 has provided us with personal information, we will delete it immediately. If you believe a child has provided us with information, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@wantok.chat">support@wantok.chat</a>.</p>

      <h2>10. International Data Transfers</h2>
      <p>WanTok operates globally. Your information may be transferred to and processed in countries other than your own, including countries that may have different data protection laws. By using the Service, you consent to the transfer of your information to these countries.</p>

      <h2>11. Third-Party Links</h2>
      <p>Our Service may contain links to third-party websites or services. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these external sites. We encourage you to review their privacy policies before providing any personal information.</p>

      <h2>12. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or legal requirements. We will notify you of significant changes by posting the new policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date. Your continued use of the Service after changes are posted constitutes your acceptance of the updated policy.</p>

      <h2>13. Contact Us</h2>
