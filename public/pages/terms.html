You may not copy, modify, distribute, or create derivative works without our express written permission.</p>

      <h2>6. Reporting and Moderation</h2>

      <h2>7. Automated Content Moderation and Monitoring</h2>
      <p>To enforce these Terms and maintain a safe environment, WanTok uses <strong>automated content moderation technology</strong> powered by artificial intelligence. By using the Service, you acknowledge and agree to the following:</p>

      <h3>7.1 AI-Powered Content Monitoring</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Automated Screening:</strong> We use third-party AI services to automatically analyze video frames from your video stream to detect nudity, sexually explicit content, weapons, drugs, and other inappropriate material that violates these Terms.</li>
        <li><strong>Screenshot Capture:</strong> When you connect to a chat or when another user reports you, we may capture a single frame (screenshot) from your video stream for automated analysis. These screenshots are processed immediately and are not permanently stored.</li>
        <li><strong>Real-Time Detection:</strong> Moderation checks may occur at any time during your use of the Service, including when you first connect to a chat.</li>
        <li><strong>No Prior Warning:</strong> If our AI systems detect prohibited content, you may be immediately disconnected and banned without prior warning.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>7.2 Strict Prohibition on Content Involving Minors</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Zero Tolerance Policy:</strong> Any content that involves, depicts, or appears to involve minors in inappropriate, sexual, or exploitative situations is <strong>absolutely prohibited</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong>Immediate Ban:</strong> If our AI systems detect or flag content that may involve minors, your account will be <strong>immediately and permanently banned</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong>Legal Reporting:</strong> We will report suspected child exploitation to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC), law enforcement, and other appropriate authorities as required by law.</li>
        <li><strong>Age Verification Required:</strong> All users must be 18 years or older. You represent and warrant that you are of legal age and that you will not display or expose any minor to the Service.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>7.3 Consent to Automated Moderation</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Consent Required:</strong> By using WanTok, you <strong>consent to automated monitoring and moderation</strong> of your video content. This includes the temporary capture and AI analysis of video frames for safety enforcement.</li>
        <li><strong>No Expectation of Privacy for Violations:</strong> While we respect your privacy during normal use, you have <strong>no expectation of privacy</strong> if you violate these Terms. We reserve the right to capture, review, and report content that violates our policies or the law.</li>
        <li><strong>Third-Party AI Services:</strong> We use third-party AI providers (such as Sightengine) to perform content analysis. By using the Service, you consent to your video frames being processed by these providers in accordance with their privacy policies.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>7.4 Consequences of Violations</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Automatic Disconnection:</strong> If prohibited content is detected, you will be immediately disconnected from the chat.</li>
        <li><strong>Account Suspension or Ban:</strong> Depending on the severity of the violation, your account may be temporarily suspended or permanently banned.</li>
        <li><strong>No Refunds:</strong> Banned users forfeit any tokens or purchased credits and are not entitled to refunds.</li>
        <li><strong>Legal Action:</strong> Severe violations, especially those involving minors or illegal content, may result in legal action and cooperation with law enforcement.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>7.5 Reporting System and AI Verification</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>User Reports:</strong> When you report another user for nudity or minor-related concerns, we may automatically capture and analyze their video using AI to verify the report.</li>
        <li><strong>False Reports:</strong> Submitting false or malicious reports may result in action against your own account.</li>
        <li><strong>Human Moderation Team:</strong> All reports and AI-flagged content are logged and reviewed by our dedicated human moderation team. While AI provides immediate automated action for clear violations, our trained moderators review cases that require additional context and make final decisions on complex enforcement actions.</li>
      </ul>
